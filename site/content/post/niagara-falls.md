  I'm just gonna have to be honest: I thought the Niagara Falls would be a
  bigger. I don't mean to complain, and I'm not one to call things "overrated",
  but let's just say that I'm less impressed with that woman who went over this
  thing in a barrel.

  I am pretty proud of this photo, though, because I was able to capture Toronto
  way in the distance. Again, though, I don't mean to be too hard to impress,
  but it's not exactly "the NYC of Canada" like people had told me.
